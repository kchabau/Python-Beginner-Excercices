# Beginner Python Projects

Beginner-level Python exercises to practice fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and user input handling. Helping build problem-solving skills and reinforce core Python syntax and logic.

## Projects

### 1. Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple command-line game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The game randomly selects a choice for the computer, and the winner is determined based on standard rules. This project introduces concepts like user input handling, randomization, and basic control flow using conditional statements. [See Code](Rock_Paper_Scisors.py)

### 2. Number Guessing Game

The program generates a random number within a specified range, and the user tries to guess it. The game provides hints whether the guessed number is too high or too low. This exercise helps improve understanding of loops, conditionals, and comparison operators while incorporating randomness. [See Code](Number_Guesshing_Game.py)

### 3. Dice Game

A simulation of rolling a six-sided die. The user can roll the die multiple times to get random results. This project is a simple introduction to using the random module, implementing loops, and managing user interactions through input and output functions. [See Code](Dice_Game.py)

### 4. QR Code Generator

A simple tool that generates QR codes from user-provided text or URLs and saves them as image files. This project introduces working with external libraries (such as `qrcode`), handling string input, and exporting data in a useful format. [See Code](Rock_Paper_Scisors.py)
